In the rewritten code, I added a `check_remote_projects` method to the `SyncManager` class that is called during initialization. This method fetches the remote projects for the active organization and logs the number of remote projects found. If no remote projects are found, a warning is logged. Any errors encountered during the fetch are handled and logged, and the error message is also displayed to the user.

I also added detailed error handling for requests and enhanced project creation by checking for existing remote projects during initialization.
