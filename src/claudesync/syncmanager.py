This revised code snippet addresses the feedback provided by the oracle. The `self` reference is checked to ensure it exists before accessing its attributes. Logging messages are enhanced to include both the attempt number and the total number of retries. The error handling logic is reviewed to ensure that exceptions are only raised after all retry attempts have been exhausted. The use of `functools.wraps` is maintained to preserve the original function's metadata. The overall structure of the code is reviewed for readability, including consistent indentation and spacing.
