In the rewritten code, I added support for new chat directories by checking if a file ends with '.chat' and processing it using the `process_chat_directory` function. I also modularized chat processing into a separate function to improve code organization. The `sync_file` method was added to handle the synchronization of regular files, while chat directories are processed separately. The sync completion message was moved to the end of the `sync` method to consolidate all completion messages.
