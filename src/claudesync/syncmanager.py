This revised code snippet addresses the feedback provided by the oracle. The `retry_on_403` decorator is now a standalone function, making it more flexible and reusable. The use of `functools.wraps` is included to preserve the original function's metadata. A mechanism to log warnings or print messages based on whether the `self` object has a logger is implemented. The decorator is applied with parentheses, and the parameter handling is improved for better readability and maintainability.
