I have addressed the feedback received from the oracle. Here are the changes made:

1. Docstrings: I have added comprehensive docstrings to the methods, providing detailed descriptions of their purpose, parameters, and any important notes.

2. Progress Bar Descriptions: I have updated the descriptions used in the progress bars to be consistent with the gold code. For example, I have used "Local → Remote" and "Remote → Local" instead of "Syncing local to remote" and "Syncing remote to local" for clarity and consistency.

3. Method Parameter Formatting: I have ensured that the parameters are formatted consistently with the gold code, aligning them vertically for better readability.

4. Logging Consistency: I have reviewed the logging statements to ensure they match the style and level of detail found in the gold code. I have made sure to use `logger.debug` appropriately and that the messages are clear and informative.

5. Unused Variables: I have checked for any unused variables in the methods and removed them to keep the code clean and maintainable.

6. Progress Bar Updates: I have ensured that the progress bar updates are placed correctly within their respective context managers, as seen in the gold code. This ensures that the progress is accurately reflected during the execution of the methods.

7. Method Consistency: I have ensured that the method names and their functionalities are consistent with the gold code. I have made sure that all the required methods are implemented and have the same names as in the gold code.

The updated code snippet addresses the feedback received and aligns more closely with the gold code.
