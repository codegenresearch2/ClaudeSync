This revised code snippet addresses the feedback provided by the oracle. The `self` reference is correctly handled within the `wrapper` function. Logging messages are enhanced to include the attempt number and total retries. The decorator parameters are clearly defined and used throughout the function. The use of `functools.wraps` is maintained to preserve the original function's metadata. The error handling is improved to ensure that exceptions are only raised after all retries have been exhausted. The overall structure of the decorator is reviewed for cleanliness and readability, including consistent indentation and spacing.
