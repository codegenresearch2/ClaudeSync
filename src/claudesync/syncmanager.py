This revised code snippet addresses the feedback from the oracle by:

1. Removing any invalid comments that were causing syntax errors.
2. Ensuring that the `retry_on_403` decorator is correctly referenced in the `SyncManager` class methods.
3. Including the attempt number in the logging messages within the `retry_on_403` decorator.
4. Using `functools.wraps` in the `retry_on_403` decorator to preserve the metadata of the original function.
5. Ensuring that the `SyncManager` class methods use `self` consistently to access instance variables and methods.
