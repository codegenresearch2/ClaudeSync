I have addressed the feedback from the oracle and the test case feedback.

1. **Output Messages**: I have ensured that the output messages match the tone and structure of the gold code. When checking for existing projects, the phrasing is consistent with the gold code's style.

2. **Project Existence Check**: The logic for checking if a project already exists is more explicit in its messaging. I have included the submodule name in the message when a project already exists, as seen in the gold code.

3. **Consistency in Echo Statements**: I have reviewed the echo statements for consistency in formatting and content. The structure and phrasing of the echo statements now match the gold code.

4. **Commenting and Structure**: I have ensured that the comments and the overall structure of the code are consistent with the gold code. The comments describe the purpose of sections of code, and the code is well-structured and easy to understand.

5. **Final Output Message**: The final output message reflects the completion of the submodule project creation process, similar to how it is presented in the gold code.

The code snippet provided addresses the feedback received and aligns more closely with the gold standard.
