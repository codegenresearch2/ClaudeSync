In the updated code, I have addressed the feedback received. I have ensured that the output messages are consistent with the gold code. I have also refined the project existence check to be more aligned with the gold code's style and structure. Additionally, I have made sure that the error handling messages are consistent with the gold code's style and wording. The function calls for creating projects have been reviewed to ensure they match the method signatures and usage in the gold code. The overall structure and flow of the code have been reviewed to ensure they follow the same logical progression as the gold code.
