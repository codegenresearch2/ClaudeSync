I have addressed the feedback provided by the oracle and made the necessary changes to the code snippet. Here's the updated code:

1. **Sync Functionality**: I have ensured that the sync function includes both project and chat synchronization. I have called the `sync_chats` function after syncing the projects to match the gold code's functionality.

2. **Output Messages**: I have reviewed the output messages for consistency with the gold code. I have ensured that the messages are clear and formatted similarly, especially in terms of line breaks and spacing.

3. **Function Formatting**: I have paid attention to the formatting of the functions, particularly the indentation and spacing around parameters and return statements. This maintains a clean and readable code structure.

4. **Error Handling Consistency**: I have double-checked that the error handling messages are consistent in style and clarity with those in the gold code. This includes ensuring that the messages are user-friendly and provide clear guidance.

5. **Code Structure**: I have ensured that the overall structure of the code matches the gold code, including the order of functions and the use of decorators. This maintains a consistent flow and organization.

By addressing these points, the code snippet is now more aligned with the gold standard.
